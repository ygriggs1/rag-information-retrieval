# RAG Information Retrieval

A focused repository for experimenting with retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) pipelines, chunking strategies, and retrieval performance.

## Goals
- Prototype RAG workflows end-to-end
- Compare chunking and embedding strategies
- Track retrieval quality and latency

## Planned Features
- Document ingestion and chunking experiments
- Vector store configuration notes
- Evaluation scripts for retrieval quality

## Project Structure
- `ingestion/` — data loaders and chunking tools (to be added)
- `retrieval/` — retrieval pipelines (to be added)
- `evaluations/` — recall/precision benchmarks (to be added)

## Getting Started
```sh
# Clone the repo
# Replace with your Git URL

git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>
cd rag-information-retrieval
```

## Roadmap
- Add baseline RAG pipeline
- Add chunking comparison notes
- Add retrieval evaluation reports
